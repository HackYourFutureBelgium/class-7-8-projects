# Final Project

> [Starter Repository](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/organized-for-deployment)

In the upcoming 6 weeks you'll be immersed into the web developer life. By the end of it you will have created and deployed a full-stack web application. Everything you have learned so far will be combined and put into practice.

Along with practicing your programming skills you will also be working on your communication skills. This is more important than coding! If you don't organize as a team it doesn't matter how good you are at coding individually, the project will never come together

## What we expect from you

This module is about much more than just the code. It's also about planning projects, structuring your development process, and working collaboratively.  This module is also the final assessment for you time at HYF.  We'll be watching you!

But what will we be watching for?

- Participation on Sundays
- Active communication on Slack
- Wednesday check-ins
- Small, well-named commits
- Disciplined branching & merging
- A clear development strategy
- Good use of issues, projects, PRs, ...

## What you can expect from the module

So that's what we expect from you, but what can you expect from yourselves?

We'll provide you with the starter code, but it's up to each team to decide what to make of it.  (We'll work with you to make sure that your ideas are possible ;).   Teams can build the same project working in parallel to find different solutions, or each team can build a different project.

Technical skills:

- How to `build a complete full-stack application`
- Understanding `how each part of an application relates` to each other
- What it means to work on a `feature`
- How to write `readable code`

Communication skills:

- How to `communicate effectively` with team members
- `Keeping track` of your project's progress
- Knowing if you `understand what's asked` of you
- How to `communicate with non-developers` about what you're doing
- Learning how to be `solutions-oriented`
- How to work in a `Scrum setting`

## The Schedule

The project module will take 6 weeks.  There are 3 different phases to the project:

### Week 1

In the first week you will become familiar with the starter repository and plan the overview of your project.  This weeks objectives include:

- Define your user stories
- Write a first-draft development strategy
- Begin planning the data tables for you application
- Begin wireframing
- Setting up the starter project
  - Add each other as collaborators
  - Set up the project board

### Week 2

In this second week your team will work on coordinating your development for the remaining 5 weeks.  This includes:

- Filling your project board with a backlog of tasks
- Defining milestones for the coming weeks
- Defining a communication plan
- Setting up the Database
- Deploy the starter code

### Weeks 3, 4, 5

Sprinting.  Standups, backlogs, tickets, code reviews ... all the fun stuff.

### Week 6

Feature Freeze!  Put the finishing touches on whatever you have working and get ready to present your project at graduation. This includes:

- Making sure your deployed app works for the live demo
- Preparing a presentation where everyone in your team will speak
- Building a static landing page for your project
- A short video add for your project, something you might see before a youtube tutorial

---

## Deliverables

After the 6th week of the final project your team will be expected deliver these five items:

### Deployed Demo

A live URL with a live demo of your project: no bugs!  no broken features!

This demo can be very simple and limited, you won't be evaluated on how complex it is.  Instead you will be evaluated on whether or not _each and every_ feature on the demo works. In the final week of the project your team will need to assess which features can be finished on time and which cannot.  Features that cannot be finished on time should be removed from the deployment branch and kept in the backlog.

If your team has been disciplined about branching and deployment throughout the whole 6 weeks, the deployed demo should be ready without any extra work.

### Landing Page

Create a [landing page](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/) for your app.  This should be a beautiful and simple single-page site that explains why a user would want to use your app and how to get started.  It should include a link to your live demo.

You are encouraged to write this using HTML/CSS/JS(/bootstrap/material/...) for simplicity, no need for a full frontend framework.  Your landing page can be hosted from your group repository's `index.html` using GitHub Pages.

### Video Spot

Produce a short (< 2min) video spot explaining your project.  The goal of this spot is to sell your app to new users.  You should not mention the technologies you used, show the code, or talk about how it was built.  You might not even include a screen shot of the app!

Think of the adds you'd see on Youtube, this is what you're aiming for. Be creative, be engagin, be convincing.

### Slide Deck

Write a slide-show to present at the graduation day. This will include (in any order):

- who is on your team
- what you built and why
  - screen shots of the landing page
  - embed the video spot
- screen shots/gifs of the live demo
- about your journey
  - development process
  - what you learned
  - what was challenging
  - what was fun
  - ...
- ... this is your project, impress yourselves :)

### Presentation

Finally your team will need to present all of this on graduation day.  Divide the presentation among yourselves, each team member should speak at least once.
