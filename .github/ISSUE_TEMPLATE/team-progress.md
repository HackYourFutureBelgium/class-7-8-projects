## Development Prep

- [ ] Backlog of tasks (issues on the project board)

  - who is responsible for what in your team?
  - ...
- [ ] Deployed starter code
  - A basic home page for your project. could even be just the team name
  - The database is defined (empty is ok, just so the tables are set)

## Sprinting!

There are no checkboxes here, you'll keep track of your progress on your team project board.

When things are going smoothly, leave your issue in the **Sprinting** column. If you need some help from us or your classmates, move your issue to the **Blocked** column.
